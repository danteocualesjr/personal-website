# The Last Light

In a world where the sun never sets, where the golden hour stretches into eternity, I found myself searching for something I had never known: darkness.

The constant light had become a burden. Every corner illuminated, every shadow banished, every secret exposed to the relentless glow. We had forgotten what it meant to have a place to hide, a moment to rest, a thought to keep private.

It was on the third day of my journey that I found it—a small cave, hidden behind a waterfall that caught the light just so, creating a perfect curtain of shadow. Inside, true darkness waited.

At first, I was afraid. The darkness felt like an absence, a void. But as my eyes adjusted (though they never truly did), I began to see something else. Not the absence of light, but the presence of something else entirely.

In that darkness, stories began to emerge. Not stories written in light, but stories written in the spaces between. Stories that could only exist when there was room for imagination, for mystery, for the unknown.

I stayed there for what felt like days, though time had lost its meaning. In the darkness, I discovered that some things are meant to be felt, not seen. Some truths are meant to be heard in silence, not shouted in the light.

When I finally emerged, blinking against the eternal sun, I carried with me something precious: the memory of darkness, and the stories it held. Stories that would never be written down, but would live in the spaces between words, in the pauses between breaths, in the shadows we create for ourselves.

The world was still bathed in light, but now I knew—darkness wasn't the absence of light. It was simply another way of seeing.
